1. HOW TO build environment in Ubuntu Linux:
   1). Be sure that sqlite3 dev library has been installed. IF NOT, run command:
          sudo apt-get install sqlite3-dev

   2). Be sure that miniupnpc client library has been installed. IF NOT, refer to website of:
       http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/

       and download miniupnpc source code with version higher than miniupnpc-1.9 (defaully using
       minupnpc-1.9.tar.gz).
       then unzip with command:
          tar -xzvf miniupnpc-1.9.tar.gz
       and do the rest things:
          cd miniupnpc
          make
          sudo make install 
      
   3). At last, download vdht source code:
          git clone https://github.com/stiartsly/vdht.git
          cd vdht
          make 


2. HOW TO understand the execuables:
   1). binaries: 
      a. vdhtd:   daemon binary to run vdht engine;
      b. vlsctlc: local service control tool to comminicate with vdhtd daemon;
      c. vserver  an example of service producer;
      d. vclient: an example of service demander;

   2). libraries (TODO):
      a. libvdht.so:   
      b. libvdhtapi.so


3. HOT TO run the executables:
   Each of executables hash it's own help information.
   1). Config valid boot node information in configle file (defaully using vdht.conf), then run:
       ./vdhtd -S 

   2). use vlsctlc command to communicate with vdhtd daemon while vdhtd is running:
      ./vlsctlc -s
