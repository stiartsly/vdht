Notice:
     1. At least one boot item should be listed in configure file (defaully @vdht.conf). When 
  VDHTD daemon begins start, it fetch boot DHT nodes addresses from configure file, and connects
  to them one by one. 

     2. For boot server item, there can be one or more address tuples, and each of them can have
  domain address or IP address directly.  
     for example:
        boot: [;;
            address: ( 
                vdht.elastos.com
                12300
                udp
            )
            address: ( 
                112.124.13.224
                12300
                udp
            )
       ]
 
     when in situation with host domain address, it can be translated to mutliple addresses, which
   currently can use following commands:
       sudo echo "112.124.13.224 vdht.elastos.com" >> /etc/hosts
       sudo echo "112.124.39.230 vdht.elastos.com" >> /etc/hosts
